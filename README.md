integrate signed message recovery directly in your contracts

---

Most of the meta transaction demos I have built to date revolve around creating a gasless layer on top of existing contracts. To do this there are a few trade offs including extra work on the frontend to track down the real msg.sender. A good example of this is in my EtherJamJam build.

I think it's important to highlight that if you are able to deploy fresh contracts you should probably be building meta transactions directly in your contracts. For instance, if you create a token, you can provide an interface and relay for your users to send their tokens without paying gas.Â

Let's build an ERC20 token that gives etherless accounts the ability to transfer() and we'll build a relay that pays the gas.
